# LampLibrary

This is a collection of helper functions for the Arduino IDE that I created in collaboration with Dr. Zane Cochran at Berry College. Dr. Cochran needed a way for new Creative Technologies majors to build simple interactive prototypes with Arduino without any previous programming experience. I worked with him to design a solution that fit his classâ€™ needs.

The Lamp Library makes it very easy to program a relationship between sensor input and Neopixel output. It has been incorporated into the curriculum for CRT101 at Berry College and is being taught to all new Creative Technologies students.
